These are Objective-C categories that I have found useful while developing. Many I have developed on my own. The rest I have borrowed from others (mostly Three20) and modified for different reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to, fixing bugs in the original category, extending category capability, reorganizing, making more generic, or conforming to my coding style.
